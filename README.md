**Security Principles**
- In this lab, I learned about the CIA triadâ€”Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, and its opposite, DAD: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction/Denial. I explored security models like Bell-LaPadula, principles such as Defense-in-Depth, Zero Trust, and Trust but Verify, and was introduced to ISO/IEC 19249. I also clarified the differences between Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk.
